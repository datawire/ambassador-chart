# Change Log

This file documents all notable changes to Ambassador Helm Chart. The release
numbering uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).

## v6.4.1

- BugFix: The `PodSecurityPolicy` should not be created by default since it is a cluster-wide resource that should only be created once. 

If you would like to use the default `PodSecurityPolicy`, make sure to unset `security.podSecurityPolicy` it in all other releases.

## v6.4.0

- Upgrade Ambassador to version 1.5.0: [CHANGELOG}](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- AuthService and RateLimitService are now installed in the same namespace as Ambassador.
- Changes RBAC permissions to better support single-namespace installations and detecting getambassador.io CRDs.
- Add option to install Service Preview components (traffic-manager, traffic-agent).
- Add option to install ambassador-injector, alongside Service Preview.
- Add additional security policy configurations.

   `securityContext` has been deprecated in favor of `security` which allows you to set container and pod security contexts as well as a default `PodSecurityPolicy`.

## v6.0.0

Introduces Ambassador Edge Stack being installed by default.

### Breaking changes

Ambassador Pro support has been removed in 6.0.0. Please upgrade to the Ambassador Edge Stack.

## v5.0.0

### Breaking changes

**Note** If upgrading an existing helm 2 installation no action is needed, previously installed CRDs will not be modified.

- Helm 3 support for CRDs was added. Specifically, the CRD templates were moved to non-templated files in the `/crds` directory, and to keep Helm 2 support they are globbed from there by `/templates/crds.yaml`. However, because Helm 3 CRDs are not templated, the labels for new installations have necessarily changed

## v4.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Introduces the performance tuned and certified build of open source Ambassador, Ambassador core
- The license key is now stored and read from a Kubernetes secret by default
- Added `.Values.pro.licenseKey.secret.enabled` `.Values.pro.licenseKey.secret.create` fields to allow multiple releases in the same namespace to use the same license key secret.

### Minor Changes

- Introduces the ability to configure resource limits for both Ambassador Pro and it's redis instance
- Introduces the ability to configure additional `AuthService` options (see [AuthService documentation](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service/))
- The ambassador-pro-auth `AuthService` and ambassador-pro-ratelimit `RateLimitService` and now created as CRDs when `.Values.crds.enabled: true`
- Fixed misnamed selector for redis instance that failed in an edge case
- Exposes annotations for redis deployment and service

## v3.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- The default annotation has been removed. The service port will be set dynamically to 8080 or 8443 for http and https respectively.
- `service.http`, `service.https`, and `additionalTCPPort` has been replaced with `service.ports`.
- `rbac.namespaced` has been removed. Use `scope.singleNamespace` instead.

### Minor Changes

- Ambassador Pro will pick up when `AMBASSADOR_ID` is set in `.Values.env` [[#15025]](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/15025).
- `{{release name}}-admins` has been renamed to `{{release name}}-admin` to match YAML install templates
- RBAC configuration has been updated to allow for CRD use when `scope.singleNamespace: true`. [[ambassador/#1576]](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1576)
- RBAC configuration now allows for multiple Ambassadors to use CRDs. Set `crds.enabled` in releases that expect CRDs [[ambassador/#1679]](https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/issues/1679)
